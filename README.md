# ðŸ§  Simple Perceptron Model in Python

This repository demonstrates a basic implementation of the Perceptron algorithm â€” one of the earliest and simplest types of artificial neural networks. It is designed for binary classification tasks and serves as a foundational concept in machine learning.

## ðŸ“˜ What is a Perceptron?

A Perceptron is a linear classifier that updates its weights based on misclassified examples. It learns to separate data into two classes using a decision boundary.
